# Exercise 4, Capstone

In this fourth and final exercise we're going to combine everything we've learned so far by creating a website using GitHub Pages.

Objectives:
1. Create a website using GitHub Pages.
2. Create a branch and start adding details to your website.
3. Using the existing GitHub workflow, make changes, push commits, and when you are ready to deploy your changes to production, open a Pull Request and merge it in.
